## Introduction
The Spring Framework is an open-source application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. It was developed by Rod Johnson in 2003. Spring Framework provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications, allowing you to focus on your application while Spring handles the infrastructure.

Spring Framework uses various techniques such as Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), Plain Old Java Object (POJO), and Dependency Injection (DI) to develop enterprise applications. It provides support for various frameworks such as Struts, Hibernate, EJB, JSF, and Tapestry.

### Uses of Spring Framework

Spring Framework is used to develop various types of applications using the Java platforms. It provides an extensive level of infrastructure support and enables you to build applications from "plain old Java objects" (POJOs) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs.

### Advantages of Spring Framework

- **Lightweight**: Spring is a lightweight framework because of its POJO implementation.
- **Flexible**: It provides flexible libraries trusted by developers all over the world.
- **Loose Coupling**: Spring applications are loosely coupled because of dependency injection.
- **Powerful Abstraction**: It provides a powerful abstraction to JEE specifications such as JMS, JDBC, JPA, and JTA.
- **Declarative Support**: It provides declarative support for caching, validation, transaction, and formatting.
- **Easy and Simple to Test**: The use of dependency injection makes testing easy.
- **Fast**: Its fast startup, fast shutdown, and optimized execution maintain performance.
- **Secure**: It monitors third-party dependencies closely.

## Getting Started

Creating a new Spring Boot application is straightforward with the help of Spring Initializr. Here are the steps to create a new Spring Boot application:

1. **Open Spring Initializr**: Visit [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) in your web browser.
2. **Fill in the Details**: Fill in the details as per your requirements, such as project type, language, Spring Boot version, and dependencies. For a web application, you need to select the Spring Web dependency.
3. **Generate the Project**: Click on "Generate" to download the starter project.
4. **Extract and Open the Project**: Extract the downloaded zip file and open it in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
5. **Run the Application**: Run the main application and see the result on `http://localhost:8080`.

Congratulations! You have just created a new Spring Boot application using Spring Initializr. You can now start adding your code and learning more about Spring Boot.
